REPOKEEPER.py  

is tool that helps you to maintain own local database of packages buid from aur

For Arch Linux only !!!

BASIC SETUP:
First you need the config file where you list packages that will be kept
in your local repo. Expected location is in /etc/repokeeper.conf.
Then you need 2 directories where packages will be built and stored.

Anyway, if you run repokeeper.py without any preparation, it will navigate 
you what to do...

HOW IT WORKS:
1. It reads config file to find out what packages you want to have in your repo
2. It checks actual versions of those packages in your repo
3. It sends query to AUR website to find out what are latest version of those
packages
4. If AUR contains newer version, it builds the packages and put the into repo dir
5. Regenerates repo db file. Note, it puts there all pkgs located in repo dir,
even those that are not in your config file. Repokeeper doesnt delete any
packages from repo directory, you have to do it by hand. Afterwards you 
can re-run repokeeper to rebuild repo db file.

ADDING REPOSITORY INTO /etc/pacman.conf
at the end of repokeeper.py output, you will see two lines that have to be
added to/present in pacman.conf. Afterwards ussual command "pacman -Sy" will
fetch data also from your local repository.
Repository name is now customizable via /etc/repokeeper.conf. The repository 
name in /etr/pacman.conf must be the same, of course.
The default is local-rk, in this case no entry in /etc/repokeeper.conf
is needed.
